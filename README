Some tools which i use personally but which may be of interest for others, too
==============================================================================

showkey.c:
   Show keyboard scancodes for FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD and Linux.

uushar:
   Like shar(1), but with an uuencode(1)/uudecode(1) binary safe layer
   added.

real-periodic.sh:
   A *real* periodic for FreeBSD and OpenBSD that ensures that the
   daily/weekly/monthly maintenance stuff is executed, even if your laptop
   is running only one hour a day.
   Invoke this once per hour in the roots crontab and disable the usual
   periodic stuff of your system instead.

git-topic-creator.pl:
   To ease maintaining of topic branches i use a linear history, so that
   i can use 'git rebase -i' for fixups and squashes, without having to
   worry about recreation of topic branches.
   Instead i tag commit messages, and use this script to create the topics
   once i'm finished.

git-pre-commit.sh:
   git(1)'s diff --check does unfortunately not offer a mode which detects
   NBSP (non-breaking space, U+00A0) characters.
   This is a real problem for keyboards (layouts) which produce combined
   sequences, i.e., the german keyboard produces NBSP for ALT+SPC, but it
   also requires ALT to get any of []|{} (ALT+[5-9]).  So NBSP's happen.
   This script can be used as (a template for a custom) pre-commit hook.

Even less of widespread usability:

arena-manager:
   Offers some automatized operations on revision control repositories,
   like updating, (fast-forward) merging, garbage-collecting.

web/:
   A brute simple set of tools to generate static and PHP enabled websites.
   The PHP stuff has not been used in about five years and thus needs
   a refresh before it is included here.  Use static webcontent, huh?!
   Please read the file web/README first.

backup.pl:
   My private backup script.  Simple (uses tar(1)), but does some stuff
   which i need for my work flow (backups data which is in local repo
   clones but not yet pushed to their "real" counterparts).

super-shutdown.c:
   Single setuid root program to invoke /sbin/shutdown(8).
   You've been warned.

cdoc-freebsd.S:
   FreeBSD 5.3 x86 prog to open/close /dev/cdrom tray.
   May work on newer ones, but haven't tried it in a while.
   It was 416 object file bytes (no .EH frames then).

openbsd-changelog-plus.pl,
openbsd-changeset-plus.pl:
   Simple scripts to ease maintaining of OpenBSD plus.html entries.
