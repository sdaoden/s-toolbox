Some tools which i use personally but which may be of interest for others, too
==============================================================================

arena-manager:
   Offers some automatized operations on revision control repositories,
   like updating, (fast-forward) merging, garbage-collecting.

git-pre-commit.sh:
   git(1)'s diff --check does unfortunately not offer a mode which detects
   NBSP (non-breaking space, U+00A0) characters.
   This is a real problem for keyboards (layouts) which produce combined
   sequences, i.e., the german keyboard produces NBSP for ALT+SPC, but it
   also requires ALT to get any of []|{} (ALT+[5-9]).  So NBSP's happen.
   This script can be used as (a template for a custom) pre-commit hook.

backup.pl:
   My private backup script.  Simple (uses tar(1)), but does some stuff
   which i need for my work flow (backups data which is in local repo
   clones but not yet pushed to their "real" counterparts).

openbsd-changelog-plus.pl:
   Simple script to ease maintaining of OpenBSD plus.html entries.
