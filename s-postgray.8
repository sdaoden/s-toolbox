.Sh DESCRIPTION
.
\*(Xx is a
.Xr postfix 1
RFC 6647 graylisting policy server, following the recommendet practice
noted in the standard document.
It supports client allow (white) and block (black) lists (blocking
should be done earlier in the processing chain, though) of domain names
(exact and wildcard) as well as IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (exact or in
CIDR notation).
It aims in being fast and secure: all the data is stored in main memory,
synchronization with backing store is only performed when the server
process is started or stopped, and the graylist database which needs
to handle network data uses a cryptographically secure hash function.
.
.Pp
\*(Xx clients are intented to be started via the
.Xr postfix 1
.Xr spawn 8
daemon, they will automatically start the server as necessary.
The server lifetime is configurable, by (compile-time) default it will
terminate itself after some time without any client connection.
Sending the server a
.Ql SIGHUP
signal will re-evaluate its configuration (which may result in program
panic if a file disappeared or memory failures occur), sending it
.Ql SIGUSR2
will save the graylist database,
whereas sending
.Ql SIGUSR1
will write some statistics to the log file.
A synchronized server
.Fl Fl shutdown
can be enforced, or an asynchronous termination by sending the server a
.Ql SIGTERM
signal.
An excessively lengthy but minimal configuration example:

.Ss "Options"
.
Options may be given in short or long form.
Resource files only support the long option form,
and only a (logical) subset of the following options.
The minute limit is 32767 (15-bit), the maximum duration is thus 22 days.
Other numbers have a limit of 31-bit (2147483647).
.Fl Fl test-mode
performs a dry-run configuration syntax test, and virtualizes it.
In the following DB means database, and GC garbage collection.
.
.Bl -tag -width ".It Fl BaNg"
.Mx Fl 4-mask
.It Fl Fl 4-mask Ar mask , Fl 4 Ar mask
IPv4 mask to strip off addresses before match.
For example 24 masks all addresses in between 127.0.0.0 and 127.0.0.255.
This is desirable since in practice MX farms are used, and/or IP
addresses are selected from a pool.
.
.Mx Fl 6-mask
.It Fl Fl 6-mask Ar mask , Fl 6 Ar mask
IPv6 mask to strip off addresses before match.
Using a mask of 64 seems to be good practice (see
.Fl Fl 4-mask ) .
.
.Mx Fl allow-file
.It Fl Fl allow-file Ar path , Fl A Ar path
Load a file of whitelist entries in the syntax described for
.Fl Fl allow .
Each line forms an entry, leading and trailing whitespace is removed.
If the first non-whitespace character is the number-sign
.Ql #
the line is a comment and discarded.
Empty lines are ignored.
.
.Mx Fl allow
.It Fl Fl allow Ar spec , Fl a Ar spec
Add a domain name or an IPv4 or IPv6 internet address, optionally in
RFC 1519 CIDR notation with network mask, to the list of allowed
clients (whitelist).
Domain names are matched exactly unless the first character is a period
.Ql \&. ,
in which case the given domain and all its subdomains will match.
For IP addresses the global masks
.Fl Fl 4-mask
and
.Fl Fl 6-mask
normalize the given address (range) if applicable.
All constructs are matched via dictionary, except for CIDR ranges with
masks smaller than the global ones, they are matched in the given order.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
exact.match
also.exact.match

# This matches d.a.s but also a.b.c.d.a.s
\&.d.a.s

# with --4-mask=24 this really is 127.0.0.0/24!
127.0.0.1

# with --6-mask=64 really 2a03:2880:20:6f06::/64
# instead of 2a03:2880:20:6f06:c000::/66!
2a03:2880:20:6f06:face:b00c:0:14/66

# with --6-mask=64 nonetheless 2a03:2880:20:4f00::/56
# This will _not_ be matched by dictionary but in order
2a03:2880:20:4f06:face:b00c:0:14/56
.Ed
.Pp
If whitelisting is really performed that late in the processing chain
it should include all big players and all normally expected endpoints;
it may be useful to run for a few days with the special 0
.Fl Fl count
and inspect the log in order to create a whitelist.
Some MTAs are picky, so driving for a while with a low count and in
.Fl Fl verbose
mode to collect more data before increasing count etc. is worthwhile.
.Pp
It should be noted that only the two VERP (variable envelope return path
addresses) delimiters plus sign
.Ql +
and equal sign
.Ql =
are understood \(em mailing list software which chooses the hyphen-minus
.Ql -
as a VERP delimiter (ezmlm instances are known which do) make
a particularly bad choice because many mailing-lists have a hyphen-minus
as a regular part of their name, so no automatic differentiation in
between the customized address part and the regular address is possible:
such addresses can only be placed in the whitelist, otherwise each and
every received message will be graylisted.
.
.Mx Fl block-file
.It Fl Fl block-file Ar path , Fl B Ar path
Load a file of blacklist entries in the syntax described for
.Fl Fl allow-file .
.
.Mx Fl block
.It Fl Fl block Ar spec , Fl b Ar spec
Add a blacklist entry, syntax identical to
.Fl Fl allow .
.
.Mx Fl count
.It Fl Fl count Ar no , Fl c Ar no
Number of SMTP message delivery retries before it is accepted.
The special value 0 will accept messages immediately, and change the
behaviour of some other settings, like
.Fl Fl limit-delay ;
it may be useful when setting up the configuration and the whitelist.
(Once regular usage begins that DB should possibly be removed.)
.
.Mx Fl delay-max
.It Fl Fl delay-max Ar mins , Fl D Ar mins
Duration until a message
.Dq is no longer a retry ,
but interpreted as a new one with a reset
.Fl Fl count .
.
.Mx Fl delay-min
.It Fl Fl delay-min Ar mins , Fl d Ar mins
Duration until a message
.Dq is a retry .
Those which come sooner do not increment
.Fl Fl count .
.
.Mx Fl delay-progressive
.It Fl Fl delay-progressive , Fl p
If set each counted retry doubles
.Fl Fl delay-min
for the next one until
.Fl Fl count
is reached.
.
.Mx Fl gc-rebalance
.It Fl Fl gc-rebalance Ar no , Fl G Ar no
Number of DB GC runs before rebalancing occurs.
Value 0 turns rebalancing off.
Rebalancing only affects shrinking of the dictionary table,
it is grown automatically as necessary, so a carefully chosen
.Fl Fl limit
may render rebalancing undesired.
.
.Mx Fl gc-timeout
.It Fl Fl gc-timeout Ar mins , Fl g Ar mins
Duration until a DB entry is seen as unused and removed.
Each time an entry is used the timeout is reset.
This timeout is also an indication for how often a GC shall be
performed, but GC happens due to circumstances, too.
.
.Mx Fl limit
.It Fl Fl limit Ar no , Fl L Ar no
Number of DB entries until new ones are not handled,
effectively turning them into whitelist members.
Data is stored compact, and the size depends on email message data,
but accounting say 128 bytes per entry might be a guideline.
In addition the dictionary table resides in one large contiguous memory
chunk, accounting 1 MB per 10000000 entries may be proper.
.
.Mx Fl limit-delay
.It Fl Fl limit-delay Ar no , Fl l Ar no
Smaller than
.Fl Fl limit ,
this number describes a limit after which creation of a new (yet
unknown) entry is delayed by a one second sleep for throttling purposes.
The value 0 disables this feature.
By choosing the right settings for
.Fl Fl limit ,
.Fl Fl limit-delay
and
.Fl Fl gc-timeout ,
it should be impossible to reach the graylist bypass limit.
Note this is not honoured if
.Fl Fl count
is 0.
.
.Mx Fl server-queue
.It Fl Fl server-queue Ar no , Fl q Ar no
The number of concurrent clients a server can handle before
.Xr accept 2 Ns
ing new ones is suspended.
This setting cannot be changed at runtime.
.
.Mx Fl server-timeout
.It Fl Fl server-timeout Ar mins , Fl t Ar mins
Duration until a \*(Xx server which does not serve any clients terminates.
The value 0 disables auto-termination.
The statistics dumped on the signal
.Ql SIGUSR1
are not saved in the DB, they only reflect the current server lifetime.
.
.Mx Fl resource-file
.It Fl Fl resource-file Ar path , Fl R Ar path
A configuration file with long options (without double hyphen-minus
.Ql Fl Fl Ns ) .
Each line forms an entry, leading and trailing whitespace is removed.
If the first non-whitespace character is the number-sign
.Ql #
the line is a comment and discarded.
Empty lines are ignored.
The server parses the configuration a second time, and from within
.Fl Fl store-path !
.
.Mx Fl store-path
.It Fl Fl store-path Ar path , Fl s Ar path
An accessible
.Pa path
to which \*(Xx will change, and where the DB and the server/client
communication socket will be created.
This setting cannot be changed at runtime.
.
.Mx Fl defer-msg
.It Fl Fl defer-msg Ar msg , Fl m Ar msg
The message in
.Xr access 5
format that
.Xr postfix 1
expects for not yet accepted messages.
This setting cannot be changed at runtime.
The default is
.Ql DEFER_IF_PERMIT 4.2.0 Service temporarily faded to Gray ,
of which only
.Ql DEFER_IF_PERMIT
is not optional; it uses an RFC 3463 extended status code:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# [4.2.0]
4.X.X Persistent Transient Failure
x.2.X Mailbox Status
X.2.0 Other or undefined mailbox status
# [4.7.1 (seen in wild; less friendly and portable!)]
x.7.X Security or Policy Status
x.7.0 Other or undefined security status
x.7.1 Delivery not authorized, message refused
      This is useful only as a permanent error.
.Ed
.Pp
If
.Xr postfix 1
address verification is used in addition, it may be better to use
graylisting (maybe second-last and) before it, and return
.Ql DEFER 4.2.0
instead, so that the more expensive address verification is performed
only when graylisting permits continuation.
.
.Mx Fl once
.It Fl Fl once , Fl o
If given the client part will only process one message.
The server process functions as usual.
.
.Mx Fl shutdown
.It Fl Fl shutdown , Fl \&.
Force a running server process to exit.
The client synchronizes on the server exit before its terminating.
It exits EX_TEMPFAIL (75) when no server is running.
.
.Mx Fl test-mode
.It Fl Fl test-mode , Fl #
Enable test mode: all options are evaluated, including
.Fl Fl allow-file ,
.Fl Fl allow ,
.Fl Fl block-file
and
.Fl Fl block
which are normally processed by only the server.
Once the command line is worked the content of all white- and blacklists
is shown, as well as the final settings of above variables.
The exit status indicates error.
It is highly recommendet to use this for configuration checks.
.
.Mx Fl verbose
.It Fl Fl verbose , Fl v
Increase log verbosity (two levels).
This might be of interest to improve the configuration,
for example data suitable for
.Fl Fl allow
and
.Fl Fl block
is logged, as is the time necessary to save and load the DB.
.
.Mx Fl long-help
.It Fl Fl long-help , Fl H
A long help listing.
.
.Mx Fl help
.It Fl Fl help , Fl h
A short help listing; not really useful for this software.
