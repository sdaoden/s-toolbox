Some tools which i use personally but which may be of interest for others, too
==============================================================================

uushar:
   Writes a sh(1) shell script to the standard output which will recreate
   the file hierarchy specified by the command line operands.  Directories
   will be recreated and must be specified before the files they contain
   Compared to the well-known shar(1) program, uushar adds optional
   compression and an uuencode(1)/uudecode(1) binary safe layer: ::

      $ uushar [--(compress|gzip|bzip2|xz)] file ...

   It is easy to insert trojan horses into uushar files.  It is strongly
   recommended that all shell archive files be examined before running them
   through sh(1).  Archives produced using this implementation of uushar
   may be easily examined with the command: ::

      $ grep '^[^X#]' shar.file

gen-uushar-wrapper:
   Creates a shell archive rather similar to uushar as above, but different
   to that the generated archive (1) consists only of executable file
   members, and (2) will be itself executable.  Run it (the generated shell
   archive script) to invoke any of the programs contained therein.  On the
   first run, the wrapper will create a hidden directory in your $TMPDIR to
   unpack the archive therein.  (Run without arguments to show the contents
   and creation date.)

real-periodic.sh:
   A *real* periodic for FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD that ensures that the
   daily/weekly/monthly maintenance stuff is executed, even if your laptop
   is running only one hour a day.
   Invoke this once per hour in the roots crontab and disable the usual
   periodic stuff of your system instead.

s-ws-check.pl:
   Check indentation, trailing whitespace and non-breaking spaces (see
   git-pre-commit.sh below) for all files given on the command line.

git-pre-commit.sh:
   git(1)'s diff --check does unfortunately not offer a mode which detects
   NBSP (non-breaking space, U+00A0) characters.
   This is a real problem for keyboards (layouts) which produce combined
   sequences, i.e., the german keyboard produces NBSP for ALT+SPC, but it
   also requires ALT to get any of []|{} (ALT+[5-9]).  So NBSP's happen.
   This script can be used as (a template for a custom) pre-commit hook.

   It also handles non-space indentations, tabulators and mixed indents,
   dependent on the environment variables NSPACEINDENT, TABINDENT and
   MIXINDENT.  E.g., this is one of my pre-commit hooks: ::

      #!/bin/sh -
      NSPACEINDENT=1 TABINDENT=1
      export NSPACEINDENT TABINDENT
      exec "$HOME/usr/bin/git-pre-commit.sh" "$@"

git-topic-creator.pl:
   To ease maintaining of topic branches i use a linear history, so that
   i can use 'git rebase -i' for fixups and squashes, without having to
   worry about recreation of topic branches.
   Instead i tag commit messages, and use this script to create the topics
   once i'm finished.

showkey.c:
   Show keyboard scancodes for FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD and Linux.
   This is not yet finished but for Linux.  But it should help to get
   you going.  (Unfortunately the BSDs are not so documented and i
   need to dig into the kernel sources to implement the missing pieces.)

Even less of widespread usability:

arena-manager:
   Offers some automatized operations on revision control repositories,
   like updating, (fast-forward) merging, garbage-collecting.

backup.pl:
   My private backup script.  Simple (uses tar(1)), but does some stuff
   which i need for my work flow (backups data which is in local repo
   clones but not yet pushed to their "real" counterparts).

super-shutdown.c:
   Single setuid root BSD program to invoke /sbin/shutdown(8), either
   to reboot or to halt the system.
   You've been warned.

cdoc-freebsd.S:
   FreeBSD 5.3 x86 prog to open/close /dev/cdrom tray.
   May work on newer ones, but haven't tried it in a while.
   It was 416 object file bytes (no .EH frames then).

openbsd-changelog-plus.pl,
openbsd-changeset-plus.pl:
   Simple scripts to ease maintaining of OpenBSD plus.html entries.

P.S.: If you do miss web/: that has been replaced by the grazy boosted
      and oh so real S-Web42 project that stands by itself
      (see http://sdaoden.users.sourceforge.net/code.html).
