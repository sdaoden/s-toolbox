.Dt UUSHAR 1
.Sh NAME
.Nm uushar
.Nd create a shell archive of uuencoded and optionally compressed files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl ZzJj
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
writes a
.Xr sh 1
shell script to standard output which will recreate the file hierarchy
specified by the command line operands.
Directories will be recreated and must be specified before the files
they contain (the
.Xr find 1
utility does this correctly).
.Pp
Different to well-known
.Xr shar 1
program,
.Nm
supports filenames with embedded space characters, forbids filenames
with embedded double-quote characters, supports optional data
compression for the embedded files and automatically applies an
.Xr uuencode 1
conversion so that the generated archive is safe for distribution via
text transport, e.g., via
.Xr mailx 1 .
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl A"
.It Fl Z
Use
.Xr compress 1
for compression.
.It Fl z
Use
.Xr gzip 1
for compression.
.It Fl J
Use
.Xr xz 1
for compression.
.It Fl j
Use
.Xr bzip2 1
for compression.
.El
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
makes no provisions for special types of files or files containing
magic characters.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To create a shell archive of the program
.Xr s-nail 1
and mail it to Rick:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd s-nail
uushar -z `find . -print` \&| mailx -s "s-nail(1) source" rick
.Ed
.Pp
To recreate the program directory:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mkdir ls
cd s-nail
\&...
<delete header lines and examine mailed archive>
\&...
sh archive
.Ed
.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
It is easy to insert trojan horses into
.Nm
files.
It is thus highly recommended that all shell archive files be examined
before running them through
.Xr sh 1 .
Archives produced using this implementation of
.Nm
may be easily examined with the command:
.Dl grep '^[^X#]' shar.file
.Sh "IMPLEMENTATION NOTES"
Note that the
.Xr uudecode 1
program must be capable of decoding to `/dev/stdout', i.e., it must be
POSIX compliant (Issue 6 iirc).
