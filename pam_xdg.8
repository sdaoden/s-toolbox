.Sh NAME
.Nm pam_xdg.so
.Nd PAM module that manages XDG Base Directories
.
.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.
.Nm
.Op Ar rundir
.Op Ar notroot
.
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.
.Nm
is a PAM module that manages creation of the
.Ev XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
directory, as well as injection of environment variables denoting all
directories specified by the
.Lk https://specifications.\:freedesktop.\:org/basedir-\:\
spec/\:basedir-\:spec-\:latest.html "XDG Base Directory Specification"
into user sessions.
.
.Pp
When linked into the PAM session system the runtime directory will be
created once a user creates his or her first login session.
Unless
.Ar rundir
was given all XDG related environment variables will be created in all
user sessions with their default or computed values, otherwise only
.Ev XDG_RUNTIME_DIR .
If
.Ar notroot
was given the module will bypass itself for root account logins and
perform no actions for root.
.
.Pp
In order to make use of this script, place the following in the control
file of desire under
.Pa /etc/pam.d ,
best maybe
.Pa /etc/pam.d/common-session
if that exists (possibly adjusting paths):
.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
session optional pam_xdg.so notroot
