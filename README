A repo of some small tools
==========================

pam_xdg.c (plus support) v0.8.2 (2024-02-27):
   XDG Base Directories support via PAM: creation of $XDG_RUNTIME_DIRs,
   injection of environment variables into sessions.  libpam and OpenPAM.
   [- port to OpenPAM (BSD).  (Jan Beich)]
   [- Allow non-XDG-standard paths via make options. (Jan Beich)]
   [- Support XDG standard 0.8]
   - Add comments; simplify one string build (possible due to "allow
     non-xdg-standard paths.."); make ball release v0.8.2.

s-cdda.c (plus support) v0.8.5 (2021-01-28):
   Access digital audio CDs (TOC, MCN, ISRC, CD-TEXT, audio tracks).
   Developed in 2020 on then current operating-systems and hardware.
   Not tested with CD-Extra etc (only proofed logically).  Linux and *BSD.

s-cdda-to-db.pl (plus support) v0.8.0 (2021-06-18):
   Queries content and data of audio CDs through s-cdda(1), collects
   informations (artist, album, song titles, etc.) of desired tracks,
   if possible correlates data with a web query against MusicBrainz,
   then places encoded tracks as well as a human readable and easily
   parseable database in a per-CD directory under a directory tree.
   The audio encoders (and sox(1) without --no-volume-normalize) need
   to be installed separately.
   (P.S.: the user will be asked to edit collected informations, and
   will be given a hand for the rather sophisticated, classical music
   aware) database layout while doing so.)
   (P.P.S.: nice foundation for link farms.)
   [.]
   - use POSIX::setlocale() instead of relying on PERL5OPT=-C.
     The latter roots in old habits originating in perl(1) evolution
     problems Y2K2-3 (5.8.0 and 5.8.1).

s-postgray.c (plus support) v0.8.2 (2024-02-29):
   postfix(1) graylisting policy daemon.  See its README + manual for more.
   [* Many, many thanks to Jens Schleusener, and his cron job!]
   - FIX: allow empty from=<> aka sender=, do not DUNNO those!
     (Empty from=<> was seen in some automated response emails.)
   - FIX: actually match small --allow/--block CIDR in order!
   - --test-mode mentions if CIDR address/mask do not fit.
   - --resource-file supports line continuation.
   - fix a bit FreeBSD capsicum call ("no problem").

Not for the masses:
-------------------

btrfs-snapshot.sh:
   Simple script to deal with BTRFS snapshots.
   [.]
   - (tar)ball support is gone; new syntax fixed.

find-command.sh:
   Find an executable command within a POSIX shell.
   which(1) is not standardized, and command(1) -v may return non-executable,
   so here is how it is possible to really find a usable executable file.
   Thanks to Robert Elz (kre).

git-topic-creator.pl:
   To ease maintaining of topic branches i use a linear history, so
   that i can use ``$ git rebase -i`` for fixups and squashes, without
   having to worry about recreation of topic branches.  Instead i tag
   commit messages, and use this script to create the topics once i am
   finished.  Read the --help output for more, and make use of verbosity
   when you use it first.

gmane-fetch.pl:
   Download NNTP articles from Gmane.org and Gwene.org, incrementally, and
   store them in (append them to) a local MBOX.
   Read and adjust the script header for documentation and configuration.

oauth-helper.py:
   Handles OAuth 2.0 credentials.  Supports Google, Microsoft, Yandex.
   [.]
   2023-03-14: add refresh_needs_authorize=, Microsoft seems to no
               longer support RFC 6749, 6. Refreshing an Access Token,
               but only  RFC 6749, 4.1.1. Authorization Request.

quote-rndtrip.sh:
   Round trip quote strings in POSIX (and elder) shell(s).
   Thanks to Robert Elz (kre).
   [- ensure outer driver(s) do not leak variabes. (Steven Penny)]

In the fog:
-----------

arena-manager:
   Offers some automatized operations on revision control repositories,
   like updating, (fast-forward) merging, garbage-collecting.

backup.sh:
   My private backup script.  Simple (uses tar(1)), but does some stuff
   which i need for my work flow (backups data which is in local repo
   clones but not yet pushed to their "real" counterparts).  Needs perl(1).
   [- FIX faulty xarg/tar -c invocations. (Ralph Corderoy)]
   XXX No longer used: i switched to (subsets of) filesystem snapshots.

cdoc-freebsd.S:
   FreeBSD 5.3 x86 prog to open/close /dev/cdrom tray.  May work on
   newer ones, but have not tried it in a while.  It had 416 object
   file bytes when everything was placed in ``.text`` (no .EH frames
   back then).

entropy-saver.c:
   Linux: for my use cases i find it annoying that "entropy_avail" is not
   incremented when i restore the saved random seed that machines have
   collected so hard.  This little program touches this count also.
   (Thanks Bernd Petrovitsch for pointing out EAGAIN and EBUSY.)
   [.]
   2022-02-23: work when /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail is not de-
               cremented when reading /dev/random.
   2022-04-20: Jason Donenfeld wrote something more generic that made it
               into busybox etc, and is therefore preferable:
                  https://git.zx2c4.com/seedrng/plain/seedrng.c
               P.S.: most preferable would be "echo seed > /dev/random"

fan-adaptive.sh:
   "Adaptive", more generic, and much more easily adaptable successor of
   fancontrol.sh.  For now with simulator and MacBook Air model support.
   See the script header for more.

gen-uushar-wrapper:
   Creates a shell archive similar to uushar as below, except that the
   archive (1) consists only of executable file members, and (2) will
   be itself executable.  Run the generated shell archive script to invoke
   any of its programs.  Upon first invocation the wrapper creates a
   hidden directory in $TMPDIR to unpack its members.
   Without arguments it shows its contents and the creation date.
   Simply execute it, it guides through the archive creation process.

real-periodic.sh:
   A real periodic for NetBSD, FreeBSD, DragonFly BSD and OpenBSD that
   ensures that the daily/weekly/monthly maintenance stuff is executed,
   even if your laptop is running only one hour a day.  Invoke this once
   per hour in the roots crontab and disable the usual periodic stuff of
   your system instead.  Note it does not deal with timezone and DST
   (daylight saving time) switches, but instead only checks the day of
   the year that is reported by date(1).  E.g., on my FreeBSD 10.0 box::

      # do daily/weekly/monthly maintenance
      15  * * * * root /usr/bin/nice -n 15 /usr/libexec/real-periodic.sh
      #1  3 * * * root periodic daily
      #15 4 * * 6 root periodic weekly
      #30 5 1 * * root periodic monthly
   ...

uushar (manual in uushar.1):
   Writes a sh(1) shell script to standard output that recreates the file
   hierarchy specified by the command line operands.  Directories will be
   recreated and must be specified before the files they contain.
   Compared to the well-known shar(1) program, uushar(1) adds optional
   compression and an uuencode(1)/uudecode(1) binary safe layer::

      $ uushar [-(Z|z|J|j)] file ...

   It is easy to insert trojan horses into uushar files.  It is thus
   strongly recommended that all shell archive files be examined before
   running them through sh(1).  Archives produced using this
   implementation of uushar may be easily examined with the command::

      $ grep '^[^X#]' shar.file

zte.sh:
   Control a ZTE modem (MF79 and many others according to web search)
   from the command line.  Needs curl(1) and OpenSSL(1).

# s-it-mode
