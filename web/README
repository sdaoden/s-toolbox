Howto use this:

1. Be warned - it's brute simple.
   It is not ment for sophisticated web programming with a deeply nested
   tagsoup, and thus has never been tested with that.
   It works pretty fine for my *private* usage case(s), though.

2. A subdirectory base/ should be present for images, styles and scripts
   and other things which should be copied unmodified.

3. A subdirectory html/ should consist of files which should be expanded.
   I.e., copy the template.* therein under whatever names, edit them and
   then..

4. Run build.sh to expand the stuff and copy it into $TMPDIR/public-html.
   There is some dumb logic in there which will copy to ~/public-html or
   ~/Sites (Mac OS X); for this to be used, change the line

      TARGETDIR="$TMPDIR/public-web"

   to

      #TARGETDIR="$TMPDIR/public-web"

5. For more commands and such, edit expand-html.pl and extend it for your
   purpose.

X. Yes i know i should update the 3 .php files to be in-sync with the
   current templates and post 'em here.
