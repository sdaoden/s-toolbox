A repo of some small tools
==========================

Somewhat useful:

entropy-saver.c:
   Linux: for my use cases i find it annoying that "entropy_avail" is not
   incremented when i restore the saved random seed that machines have
   collected so hard.  This little program touches this count also.
   ...
   2019-01-21: Small fixes, and take care for EAGAIN (Bernd Petrovitsch).
   2019-01-24: use syslog(3) instead; also test EBUSY (Bernd Petrovitsch).

fan-adaptive.sh:
   "Adaptive", more generic, and much more easily adaptable successor of
   fancontrol.sh.  For now with simulator and MacBook Air model support.
   See the script header for more.
   ...
   2019-04-09: add a SIGTSTP handler which only stops fans.

find-command.sh:
   Find an executable command within a POSIX shell.
   which(1) is not standardized, and command(1) -v may return non-executable,
   so here is how it is possible to really find a usable executable file.
   Thanks to Robert Elz (kre).
   ...
   2019-02-05: truly support presets again (e.g. "awk=nawk TESTFUN ...").

git-topic-creator.pl:
   To ease maintaining of topic branches i use a linear history, so
   that i can use ``$ git rebase -i`` for fixups and squashes, without
   having to worry about recreation of topic branches.  Instead i tag
   commit messages, and use this script to create the topics once i am
   finished.  Read the --help output for more, and make use of verbosity
   when you use it first.

   2013-09-13: newer git(1) reverse ``rev-parse`` output: adjusted.

gmane-fetch.pl:
   Download NNTP articles from Gmane.org and Gwene.org, incrementally, and
   store them in (append them to) a local MBOX.
   Read and adjust the script header for documentation and configuration.
   ...
   2017-07-24: add support for multiple servers and add gwene.org.

quote-rndtrip.sh:
   Round trip quote strings in POSIX (and elder) shell(s).
   Thanks to Robert Elz (kre).

   2019-05-27: ensure outer driver(s) do not leak variabes (Steven Penny).

s-cdda.c (manual in s-cdda.1; s-cdda.makefile) v0.8.3:
   Access digital audio CDs (TOC, MCN, ISRC, CD-TEXT, audio tracks).
   Developed in 2020 on then current operating-systems and hardware.
   Not tested with CD-Extra etc (only proofed logically.

   2020-03-03: base even track reading upon SCSI MMC commands.
               And port to DragonFly BSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD.
   ..2020-06-12: CD-TEXT dump generated [CDDB] section, should be [ALBUM]

s-cdda-to-db.pl (manual in s-cdda-to-db.1; s-cdda-to-db.makefile) v0.6.0:
   Queries the content and data of audio CDs through s-cdda(1), collects
   informations, like the name of the artist, album, song titles, etc., of
   desired audio tracks, also over the world wide web if possible, and
   integrates encoded variants of the audio tracks as well as a human
   readable database file in a per-CD directory under a directory tree.
   Multiple audio encoding formats are supported, and as much of the
   collected information as possible is also stored in the encoded files
   itself.  The user will be asked to edit collected informations, and will
   be given documentation for the rather sophisticated (classical music
   aware) database layout while doing so.

   2020-06-13: taken over from former musicbox.git repository.
   2020-06-16: Hunt bugs in this 2020 rewrite.
   2020-06-20: add MusicBrainz CD information support, go for v0.6.0.

zte.sh:
   Control a ZTE modem (MF79 and many others according to web search)
   from the command line.  Needs curl(1) and OpenSSL(1).
   ..
   2018-12-26: "login" now asks until there is a password, but PASSWORD=
               could still be set to avoid that.

You likely do not wanna know:

arena-manager:
   Offers some automatized operations on revision control repositories,
   like updating, (fast-forward) merging, garbage-collecting.

backup.sh:
   My private backup script.  Simple (uses tar(1)), but does some stuff
   which i need for my work flow (backups data which is in local repo
   clones but not yet pushed to their "real" counterparts).  Needs perl(1).
   P.S.: it is fantastic to have a filesystem with snapshots thats can be
   "send" in addition!
   ...
   2016-08-27: FIX faulty xarg/tar -c invocations (Ralph Corderoy)
   2019-05-10: extend exclude glob.

btrfs-snapshot.sh:
   Simple script to deal with BTRFS snapshots.
   ...
   2019-09-29: allow directories as arguments to receive-ball.
   2020-08-18: drop {create,receive}-ball, introduce ditto -balls:
               create one ball per subvolume in a .snaps-DATE directory.
               Files are split(1) at 2 GB size boundaries, and zstd(1)
               compresssed.  Copy that around via cp -n -v -R.

cdoc-freebsd.S:
   FreeBSD 5.3 x86 prog to open/close /dev/cdrom tray.  May work on
   newer ones, but have not tried it in a while.  It had 416 object
   file bytes when everything was placed in ``.text`` (no .EH frames
   back then).

gen-uushar-wrapper:
   Creates a shell archive similar to uushar as below, except that the
   archive (1) consists only of executable file members, and (2) will
   be itself executable.  Run the generated shell archive script to invoke
   any of its programs.  Upon first invocation the wrapper creates a
   hidden directory in $TMPDIR to unpack its members.
   Without arguments it shows its contents and the creation date.
   Simply execute it, it guides through the archive creation process.
   ...
   2016-01-05: port to FreeBSD: uudecode(1) does not honour /dev/stdout
               in-stream, so give -o command line option.

real-periodic.sh:
   A _real_ periodic for NetBSD, FreeBSD, DragonFly BSD and OpenBSD that
   ensures that the daily/weekly/monthly maintenance stuff is executed,
   even if your laptop is running only one hour a day.  Invoke this once
   per hour in the roots crontab and disable the usual periodic stuff of
   your system instead.  Note it does not deal with timezone and DST
   (daylight saving time) switches, but instead only checks the day of
   the year that is reported by date(1).  E.g., on my FreeBSD 10.0 box::

      # do daily/weekly/monthly maintenance
      15  * * * * root /usr/bin/nice -n 15 /usr/libexec/real-periodic.sh
      #1  3 * * * root periodic daily
      #15 4 * * 6 root periodic weekly
      #30 5 1 * * root periodic monthly
   ...

uushar (manual in uushar.1):
   Writes a sh(1) shell script to standard output that recreates the file
   hierarchy specified by the command line operands.  Directories will be
   recreated and must be specified before the files they contain.
   Compared to the well-known shar(1) program, uushar(1) adds optional
   compression and an uuencode(1)/uudecode(1) binary safe layer::

      $ uushar [-(Z|z|J|j)] file ...

   It is easy to insert trojan horses into uushar files.  It is thus
   strongly recommended that all shell archive files be examined before
   running them through sh(1).  Archives produced using this
   implementation of uushar may be easily examined with the command::

      $ grep '^[^X#]' shar.file
   ...

# s-it-mode
