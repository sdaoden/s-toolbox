 Navigation bars can be found at the top and the bottom of each page,
 which provide a subset of the following symbols:
 <?ev NAVI_UP?> loads the parent chapter,
 <?ev NAVI_FIRST?> and <?ev NAVI_LAST?> load the first and last page of
 a section, respectively,
 <?ev NAVI_PREV?> and <?ev NAVI_NEXT?> load the previous/the next page;
 likewise &uarr; and &darr; can be used to scroll to the top and the
 bottom of the currently loaded page.
 Hyperlinks which refer to other sites on the internet are
 <em>explicitly</em> marked (preceeded) with <?ev WWW?>.
 As you can see UNICODE characters are used instead of images -
 try an UTF-8 aware locale/console/browser if you have display problems.
